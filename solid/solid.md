# SOLID PRINCIPLES

# 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) / Separation of Concern (SOC)
- The idea is:
    If you have a class, that class should have its primary responsibility. It should not take on other responsibility.

# 2. Open Close Principle
- The idea is:
    A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    - No new methods continously getting added.
    - Rather create a specific class called specification and
        create operator classes that operate on the specification. Like filter.

# 3. Liskov Substitution
- The idea is:
    If you have an interface, then you should just be able to stick
    a derived class in there and there should be no problem.

# 4. Interface Segregation
- The idea is:
    YAGNI - You ain't gonna need it

# 5. Dependency Inversion
- The idea is:
    Higher level Modules shouldn't depend upon the lower level modules.
